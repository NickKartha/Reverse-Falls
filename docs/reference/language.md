# WebStory Language Reference

WebStories are written in a language that was developed specifically for WebStory Engine.
The language is both easy to learn for beginners and flexible enough for advanced users.

A WebStory consists of one or more story files written in [xmugly](https://npmjs.org/package/xmugly).
Xmugly is a nicer syntax on top of [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML). If you're an
advanced user, it also allows you to write XML directly.

When you've downloaded and extracted WebStory Engine, you can find some example story files
in the `story/` folder. The main file is `story/game.xmugly` and it references the other
story files.

This language reference is divided into these parts:

* [Syntax Guide](syntax.md)
* [Structure of WebStory files](structure.md)
* [List of all available elements](elements.md)
